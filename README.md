# bioinformatics_specialization
Files in association with the Genomic Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins. 
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science

There are 8 courses in this specialization including: 
## 1. Introduction to Genomic Technologies
This course introduces you to the basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools that we use to measure it. We'll introduce the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and cover how next-generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. You'll also get an introduction to the key concepts in computing and data science that you'll need to understand how data from next-generation sequencing experiments are generated and analyzed.

## 2. Genomic Data Science with Galaxy
Learn to use the tools that are available from the Galaxy Project. This is the second course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization.

## 3. Python for Genomic Data Science
This class provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook. This is the third course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.
#### Notebooks: 
* 'Working_with_Galaxy_Course_Project_Supplemental_Code.ipynb' 

## 4. Algorithms for DNA Sequencing
We will learn computational methods -- algorithms and data structures -- for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We will learn a little about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used. We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets.

#### Notebooks: 
* 'parsing_sequencing_reads.ipynb'

## 5. Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science
Introduces to the commands that you need to manage and analyze directories, files, and large sets of genomic data. This is the fourth course in the Genomic Big Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

## 6. Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
Learn to use tools from the Bioconductor project to perform analysis of genomic data. This is the fifth course in the Genomic Big Data Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

## 7. Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
Learn to use tools from the Bioconductor project to perform analysis of genomic data. This is the fifth course in the Genomic Big Data Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

## 8. Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
Learn to use tools from the Bioconductor project to perform analysis of genomic data. This is the fifth course in the Genomic Big Data Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.
