Some notes on what each notebook contains: 

**'Parsing_sequencing_reads'**
* Find motifs within sequences - find their position and the number of times they occur
* Find motifs within the reverse complement of the sequence
* Find the motif's reverse complement within the original sequence
* Find motoifs in a sequence allowing for a given number of mismatches
* Find out if there are any positions along the read with lower quality on average than other positions. This would indicate an error with the sequencer.
